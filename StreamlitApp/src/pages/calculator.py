## Welcome!
Please check out our **AI Text Editor** on Nimbus' [Extended Page](https://nimbus-ai-inc-extension.herokuapp.com/).

## Why is Nimbus Split Into Two Sites?
Our Machine Learning Web Applications were deployed onto Heroku's servers, which limits the slugsize to 500 MB. 

As we added more applications to Nimbus, our slugsize increased, and we were forced to split our apps onto two websites, hence the creation of the **Nimbus AI Entension**.
